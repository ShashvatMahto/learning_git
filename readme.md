// Git And Git Hub

1. What is version control System?
-- it is a system used for tracking and managing software code changes

for example : I wrote a code which does somrthing and another developer worte some other function and it goes on and on

so in order to track changes in our code we use vcs using this if one of the state got a bug then we can revert back to the prev state

Famous Vcs:
-- Git
-- APache subversion
-- Piper used by google

2. Initiallizing Git
-- install git in your local machine

-- use common git init inside the folder you want to track changes

-- this will make the files in your folder as untracked(U) i.e you have initialize your git folder but git is not tracking it

3. Adding the files to Vcs or git
-- git add <file Name>
this is use if you want to add files one by one

-- git add . this command will add all the files directly
